A software engineer located in Auckland, New Zealand, originally from Lebanon. I like coding and solving problems in innovative ways.

Programming is not just a job I do, but a philosophy that affects all aspects of my life.
Between coding and reading more about code, I like to cook, eat new types of food, sip coffee, travel to new places and meet interesting new people.

Be happy and code!
