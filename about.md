A software engineer located in Auckland, New Zealand, originally from Lebanon. I like coding and solving problems with innovative ways.
I found programming, not just a job I do, but a philosophy and way that affect all aspects of my life.
Between coding and read about more code, I like to do some cooking, eating new types of food, sipping coffee, traveling to new places and meet new interesting people.

Be happy and code!
