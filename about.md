A software engineer located in Auckland, New Zealand, originally from Lebanon. I like coding and solving problems with innovative ways.
Programming is not just a job I do, but a Philosophy that affects all aspects of my life
Between coding and reading more about code, I like to cook, eat new types of food, sip coffee, travel to new places and meet interesting new people.

Be happy and code!
